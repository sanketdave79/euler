Project EULER
=====

Check out the website www.projecteuler.net

Once you will register you will see around 4000 Maths problems. 

Inorder to solve those questions , it requires to build correct logic as numbers are big.

So I can write a method for each question , and print the answer.

By sumiting the answer I will know if answer is Wrong or Correct . 

If answer is correct I will  get a PDF File with pseudo code at the end, I will also get access to forum in which people have posted their solutions.
